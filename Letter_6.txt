Rome
December 23, 1903
My dear Mr. Kappus,
I don’t want you to be without a greeting from me when Christmas comes
and when you, in the midst of the holiday, are bearing your solitude more heavily
than usual. But when you notice that it is vast, you should be happy; for what
(you should ask yourself) would a solitude be that was not vast; there is only one
solitude, and it is vast, heavy, difficult to bear, and almost everyone has hours
when he would gladly exchange it for any kind of sociability, however trivial or
cheap, for the tiniest outward agreement with the first person who comes along,
the most unworthy. . . . But perhaps these are the very hours during which
solitude grows; for its growing is painful as the growing of boys and sad as the
beginning of spring. But that must not confuse you. What is necessary, after all, is
only this: solitude, vast inner solitude. To walk inside yourself and meet no one
for hours — that is what you must be able to attain. To be solitary as you were
when you were a child, when the grown-ups walked around involved with
matters that seemed large and important because they looked so busy and
because you didn’t understand a thing about what they were doing.
And when you realize that their activities are shabby, that their vocations are
petrified and no longer connected with life, why not then continue to look upon
it all as a child would, as if you were looking at something unfamiliar, out of the
depths of your own solitude, which is itself work and status and vocation? Why
should you want to give up a child’s wise not-understanding in exchange for
defensiveness and scorn, since not-understanding is, after all, a way of being
alone, whereas defensiveness and scorn are participation in precisely what, by
these means, you want to separate yourself from.
Think, dear Sir, of the world that you carry inside you, and call this thinking
whatever you want to: a remembering of your own childhood or a yearning
toward a future of your own — only be attentive to what is arising within you,
and place that above everything you perceive around you. What is happening on
your innermost self is worthy of your entire love; somehow you must find a way
to work at it, and not lose too much time or too much courage in clarifying your
attitude toward people. Who says that you have any attitude at all?— I know,
your profession is hard and full of things that contradict you, and I foresaw your
lament and knew that it would come. Now that it has come, there is nothing I
can say to reassure you, I can only suggest that perhaps all professions are like
that, filled with demands, filled with hostility toward the individual, saturated as
it were with the hatred of those who find themselves mute and sullen in an
insipid duty. The situation you must live in now is not more heavily burdened
with conventions, prejudices, and false ideas than all the other situations, and if
there are some that pretend to offer a greater freedom, there is nevertheless note
that is, in itself, vast and spacious and connected to the important Things that
the truest kind of life consists of. Only the individual who is solitary is placed
under the deepest laws like a Thing, and when he walks out into the rising dawn
or looks out into the event-filled evening and when he feels what is happening
there, all situations drop from him as if from a dead man, though he stands in
the midst of pure life. What you, dear Mr. Kappus, now have to experience as an
officer, you would have felt in just the same way in any of the established
professions; yes, even if, outside any position, you had simply tried to find some
easy and independent contact with society, this feeling of being hemmed in
would not have been spared you. — It is like this everywhere; but that is no cause
for anxiety or sadness; if there is nothing you can share with other people, try to
be close to Things; they will not abandon you; and the nights are still there, and
the winds that move through the trees and across many lands; everything in the
world of Things and animals is still filled with happening, which you can take
part in; and children are still the way you were as a child, sad and happy in just
the same way — and if you think of your childhood, you once again live among
them, and the grown-ups are nothing, and their dignity has no value.
And if it frightens and torments you to think of childhood and of the
simplicity and silence that accompanies it, because you can no longer believe in
God, who appears in it everywhere, when ask yourself, dear Mr. Kappus, whether
you have really lost God. Isn’t it much truer to say that you have never yet
possessed him? For when could that have been? Do you think that a child can
hold him, him whom grown men bear only with great effort and whose weight
crushes the old? Do you suppose that someone who really has him could lose
him like a little stone? Or don’t you think that someone who once had him could
only be lost by him? — But if you realize that he did not exist in your childhood,
and did not exist previously, if you suspect that Christ was deluded by his
yearning and Muhammad deceived by his pride — and if you are terrified to feel
that even now he does not exist, even at this moment when we are talking about
him — what justifies you then, if he never existed, in missing him like someone
who has passed away and in searching for him as though he were lost?
Why don’t you think of him as the one who is coming, who has been
approaching from all eternity, the one who will someday arrive, the ultimate fruit
of a tree whose leaves we are? What keeps you from projecting his birth into the
ages that are coming into existence, and living your life as a painful and lovely
day in the history of a great pregnancy? Don’t you see how everything that
happens is again and again a beginning, and couldn’t it be His beginning, since,
in itself, starting is always so beautiful? If he is the most perfect one, must not
what is less perfect precede him, so that he can choose himself out of fullness and
superabundance? — Must not he be the last one, so that he can include everything
in himself, and what meaning would we have if he whom we are longing
for has already existed?
As bees gather honey, so we collect what is sweetest out of all things and
build Him. Even with the trivial, with the insignificant (as long as it is done out
of love) we begin, with work and with the repose that comes afterward, with a
silence or with a small solitary joy, with everything that we do alone, without
anyone to join or help us, we start Him whom we will not live to see, just as our
ancestors could not live to see us. And yet they, who passed away long ago, still
exist in us, as predisposition, as burden upon our fate, as murmuring blood, and
as gesture that rises up from the depths of time.
Is there anything that can deprive you of the hope that in this way you will
someday exist in Him, who is the farthest, the outermost limit?
Dear Mr. Kappus, celebrate Christmas in this devout feeling, that perhaps
He needs this very anguish of yours in order to being; these very days of your
transition are perhaps the time when everything in you is working at Him, as you
once worked at Him in your childhood, breathlessly. Be patient and without
most solemn bitterness, and realize that the least we can do is to make coming
into existence no more difficult for Him than the earth does for spring when it
wants to come.
And be glad and confident.
Yours,
Rainer Maria Rilke
